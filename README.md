<h2>‚ö° About Me</h2>

I am Currently in my fifth year of my Engineering degree, where I'll receive a Master's degree in Electroacoustics. Additionally, I'm simultaneously pursuing a degree in Computer Science/Engineering. <br/>
I work as a programmer, having worked for national companies and freelance as a video game developer. I also dedicate myself to teaching; I've taught Mathematics, Physics, and even music in local schools. <br/>
I'm passionate about the worlds of programming and audio, and I find the intersection between both disciplines very interesting.
